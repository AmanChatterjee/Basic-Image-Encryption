# Basic-Image-Encryption
This project is a Java-based application designed to encrypt grayscale images using a custom encryption algorithm. The tool allows users to input the path of an image file and an encryption key, then applies a series of mathematical operations to each pixel based on the provided key and other dynamic factors. The encrypted image is saved to a user-specified location. The program includes error handling to ensure that unsupported or non-existent files are properly managed. By updating the encryption key dynamically during the process, the tool adds an extra layer of security. This project is ideal for learning about image processing, file handling, and implementing custom encryption algorithms in Java. To use the tool, compile and run the program, follow the prompts to provide the image path and key, and specify the output path for the encrypted image.
